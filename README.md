### Introduction
This is my first attempt at working with an API outside of a web development course. The APi is [The CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). I ran into a fair bit of trouble because some ingredients in the JSON didn't have matching measurements, so making organized pairs wasn't working the way I had hoped. I went around this by hard coding a space for available measurements and ingredients, and anything that was listed as "null" was replaced with an empty string. Many of the more complicated searches the database had available were a paid-only service, so it is only searchable by part of a name.


### Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript/ECMAScript 6


### Project Status
This project is closed, except for fine-tuning some of the code as I learn more.
